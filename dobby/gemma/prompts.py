"""Versioned prompt pack for the local Gemma checker.

Every Gemma call in Dobby takes its system prompt, JSON schema and
token budget from here, so a prompt change is one diff, carries a version, and
can be measured with ``scripts/eval_prompts.py`` before it lands.

Rules the prompts follow (they are a checker, not a planner):

- Gemma never emits click coordinates for the planner; boxes and marks are chosen
  from candidates the code drew.
- Answers are three-valued where the crop may not show enough: ``yes``, ``no``,
  ``unsure``. ``unsure`` means "send a screenshot to the planner", never a guess.
- Evidence is the exact visible text when there is any, so it can be checked
  against local OCR (see :func:`evidence_in_ocr`).

A local override can replace any system prompt without editing code: put
``<id>.txt`` in ``CONFIG.gemma3_prompt_dir``. The version then reads
``<version>+local`` in results and eval reports.
