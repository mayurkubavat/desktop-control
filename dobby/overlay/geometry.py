"""Pure geometry helpers for the overlay (no AppKit, unit-testable anywhere).

Two coordinate systems meet here:

* Quartz / AX "global" space: points, origin at the top-left of the primary
  display, y grows downward. Dobby actions and CGWindowList bounds use this.
* Cocoa space: points, origin at the bottom-left of the primary display,
  y grows upward. NSScreen.frame() and NSWindow frames use this.

Each overlay panel covers one screen and draws in its own local, non-flipped
layer coordinates (origin bottom-left of that screen).
