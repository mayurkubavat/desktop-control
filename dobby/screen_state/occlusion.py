"""
Is something covering the target before we click it?

Two cheap checks, both before the click and both from data we already have:

1. Window order: ``hal.list_windows()`` is front to back. If a window in front
   of the target's window contains the click point, the click would land on
   that window instead.
2. Accessibility hit test (macOS, optional): the element at the click point.
   If it is a sheet, popover, menu or dialog that is not the target itself, or
   its frame does not overlap the target at all, the target is covered.

A check that cannot run (no window list, no hit test) says "unknown" and never
blocks a click by itself.
