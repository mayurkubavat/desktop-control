"""
Choose from the screenshot when the text view is not enough.

Some apps draw controls the accessibility tree does not name (toolbar icons in
EDA tools, canvas apps, custom widgets). ``decide_visual_element`` shows local
Gemma the window with lettered boxes drawn on it (Set-of-Marks) and scores the
letters from logprobs, the same typed decision as the text lane. Coordinates
always come from the boxes, never from the model.

The pick is then checked with an absolute yes/no question on a crop of the
chosen box, because a choice is only relative to the boxes it was shown.
