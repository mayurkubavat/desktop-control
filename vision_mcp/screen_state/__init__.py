"""
Screen state: one numbered, text-only view of the active window.

Merges the accessibility tree and OCR into a short list of elements with
stable ids (``e1``, ``e2``...), coarse positions and the operations that are
valid right now, stamped with an observation generation. A decider (local
Gemma through :mod:`vision_mcp.gemma.decide`, or Claude) chooses from that
list; the executor re-binds the chosen element on a fresh observation before
acting. Pattern after the fka.dev Jev harness for macOS.
